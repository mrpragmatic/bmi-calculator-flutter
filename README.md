# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## Our Goal
This is a tutorial from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=LongTail_la.EN_cc.INDIA&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_77882236463_._ad_437477391738_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1007766171312_._li_1007796_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs_m786qi7AIVR6aWCh00gAx6EAAYASAAEgIjgfD_BwE)
The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 


## What you will create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
